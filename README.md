🛍 Shopping Mall Management System (C++)

The Shopping Mall Management System is a console-based application developed in C++ that simulates a real-world online shopping experience. This system allows users to browse different product categories, select items, add them to a shopping cart, and proceed to checkout.

The program is designed using core C++ concepts such as classes, objects, arrays, loops, conditional statements, and functions. Each product contains details such as item name, price, and quantity. Users can view available products, add multiple items to their cart, remove items if needed, and calculate the total bill automatically.

The system ensures a simple and user-friendly interface where customers can:

View product list

Add items to cart

Update item quantity

Remove items from cart

View total price

Checkout and generate final bill

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles like encapsulation and modularity while simulating a real shopping mall environment.
